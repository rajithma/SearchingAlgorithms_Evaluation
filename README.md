# Searching Algorithms Performance Evaluation

Searching is a fundamental operation in computer science, and various algorithms exist to address this task efficiently. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of different searching algorithms under various conditions. The system serves as a searching machine, analyzing the behavior of algorithms with different input data types, sizes, and implementation platforms.

# Variations
The evaluation encompasses several variation categories to ensure a thorough examination:

# Size of the Data Set:
1000
10000
100000, etc.

# Variation of Searching Algorithms:
Linear Search
Binary Search
Jump Search
Interpolation Search
Exponential Search.

# Test Environment
To ensure consistency in comparison, the application test environment remains constant across evaluations. Environmental properties such as memory size, CPU specifications, remaining disk capacity, etc., are automatically generated from the implementation language. This is achieved using a containerized environment or any other relevant method to maintain consistency.

# Test Results
The performance of each algorithm under different variations is recorded in a tabular format.                                   

# Visualization
To illustrate the performance of each algorithm's behavior, bar or pie charts will be drawn based on the test results. The visualization will provide a clear representation of the efficiency and effectiveness of each searching algorithm under different variations.

# Conclusion
The performance evaluation aims to provide insights into the behavior of searching algorithms across various conditions. By analyzing the results and visualizations, the most suitable algorithm for specific scenarios can be identified, contributing to better decision-making in software development and optimization.
